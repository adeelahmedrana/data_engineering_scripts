# Case from IBM Data Engineering
I have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York-based coffee shop chain that is expanding nationally by opening several franchise locations. As part of this expansion, the company aims to streamline its operations and revamp its data infrastructure.

My primary responsibility is to design relational database systems that improve operational efficiencies and enable executives to make data-driven decisions. Currently, the company's data is scattered across multiple systems, including accounting software, supplier databases, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and spreadsheets. I will review the data in all of these sources and design a centralized database to consolidate the information.

Once the design is complete, I will create the necessary database objects and load them with data from the source systems. After that, I will generate subsets of data required by various business partners, export them, and load them into staging databases using multiple RDBMS platforms.
